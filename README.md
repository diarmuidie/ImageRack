=========

> Project repo for the [ImageRack PHP lib](https://github.com/diarmuidie/ImageRack-Kernel). Simple PHP image processor and server.

Developed by [Diarmuid](https://diarmuid.ie).

Features
--------

- Resizes images on the fly based on predefined user templates.
- Uses the [Intervention image library](https://github.com/Intervention/image) for easy image manipulation using GD or Imagick.
- Integrates with local or remote (Amazon S3, SFTP, Azure etc.) image stores using the [PHP League Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/) filesystem abstraction library.
- Ability to cache processed images so that subsequent requests are served quickly.
- SEO friendly and easy to use URLs i.e. `example.com/<template>/path/to/source/image.png`.
- Supports PNG/JPEG/GIF images.
- Adds `Cache-Control`, `ETag` and `Last_Modified` headers to response for better browser and CDN caching.

Usage
-----

>_Sample Heroku Setup guide and code:_ [diarmuid.ie/blog/setting-up-a-php-image-server-on-heroku](http://diarmuid.ie/blog/setting-up-a-php-image-server-on-heroku/).

To start a new project use the composer `create-project` command to install the ImageRack package in a named folder:

```
composer create-project diarmuidie/imagerack <folder-name>
```

Once the package is installed you can edit the contents of:

- `public/index.php` The main file that all requests are handled by.
- `bootstrap/dependencies.local.sample.php` Where the Flysystem and Intervention Image dependencies are configured.
- `templates/` Where your templates for resizing media will be stored.

### Server Configuration

#### Apache
Ensure the `public/` directory is setup as your public-accessible DocumentRoot. The provided `.htaccess` file will redirect all requests to the ImageRack server.

#### Nginx
The Nginx configuration file should include the following information (in addition to any other settings you require):
```
root /some/folder/public;
index  index.php;

location ~ \.php$ {
    ...
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    ...
}

```

### Single Server Setup
A single server deploy is the most straight forward configuration. Source images must be stored in the `storage/source` folder. Resized images will be cached in `storage/cache`.


### Multi-Server Setup
To use the ImageRack server in a multi-server environment (i.e. more than one web servers sitting behind a load ballancer) you must store the source and cache images in a distributed filesystem.

ImageRack comes with a sample configuration for using AWS S3 for this. To use this configuration you must make sure the Flysystem S3 adapter is installed:

```
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

Then you can edit `public/index.php` to load the sample S3 dependencies:

```php
$dependencies = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/dependencies.s3.sample.php';
```

You will also have to change the `bootstrap/dependencies.s3.sample.php` file to use your S3 Secret and Key and change the bucket names.

Configuration
-------------

ImageRack allows you to configure the server in a number of ways:

### HTTP Cache Max Age
You can overwrite the default http cache max age header value (30 days):

```php
$server->setHttpCacheMaxAge(86000); // 86000 seconds = 1 day
```

Setting the cache duration to zero will disable the cache by setting a `Cache-Control:no-cache` header.

### Templates
Templates are objects that define how an image should be manipulated. You can create multiple tempaltes to manipuate an image in different ways. Templates must implement the [Diarmuidie\ImageRack\Image\TemplateInterface](https://github.com/diarmuidie/ImageRack-Kernel/blob/master/src/Image/TemplateInterface.php) interface. There is a [sample template](https://github.com/diarmuidie/ImageRack/blob/master/templates/Small.php) provided with ImageRack for resizing images to 320Ã—240px.

After you create a new template it must be registered in the server:

```php
$server->setTemplate(
    'large',
    function () {
        return new Templates\Large();
    }
);
```

The template name (`large` in this example) must be URL safe as it is used to access images using this template i.e. `example.com/large/path/to/image.jpg`.

### Not Found Response
You can set an optional "not found" response. By default a 404 header will be sent with the body "File not found". However this can be modified using the `setNotFound()` method:

```php
$server->setNotFound(function ($response) {

    // Edit the response as required.
    // For example here we cahnge the content
    $response->setContent('Image not found.');

    // Return the modified response
    return $response;

});
```

`$response` is an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`. See the [Symfony HTTP-Foundation docs](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html#response) for more info on what you can do with the response.


### Error Response
You can set an optional "error" response. By default a 500 header will be sent with the body "There has been a problem serving this request". However this can be modified using the `setError()` method:

```php
$server->setError(function ($response, $exception) {

    // Edit the response as required.
    // For example here we add the exception message to the content
    $response->setContent('An internal error occurred. ' . $exception->getMessage());

    // Return the modified response
    return $response;

});
```

`$exception` is an instance of the caught exception.

`$response` is an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`. See the [Symfony HTTP-Foundation docs](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html#response) for more info on what you can do with the response.
